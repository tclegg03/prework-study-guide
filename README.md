- I was motivated to build this webpage because I wanted to better understand how coding and web design works.
- I built this project as a way to challenge myself in an area that I am not very comfortable in. 
- This project helped to show me that coding can be difficult at times, but it is possible to learn
- What I learned by making this project are various steps in the web design process. Such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
